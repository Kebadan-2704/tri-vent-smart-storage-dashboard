# Tri-Vent Smart Storage Dashboard

An AI-powered, multi-zone smart storage monitoring dashboard designed to
demonstrate independent microclimate control, spoilage prediction, and
explainable AI-driven decision support.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Traditional cold storage systems apply uniform temperature and humidity
controls, leading to cross-contamination, ethylene-induced spoilage,
and inefficient energy usage.

## 💡 Solution
Tri-Vent introduces three independently regulated storage zones with
real-time monitoring, predictive spoilage analysis, and AI-based
explanations for control decisions.

## 🧊 Storage Zones
- **Zone A – Protein Storage**
  - 0–4 °C | Odor-isolated | Microbial suppression
- **Zone B – Fruit Preservation**
  - 0–8 °C | Ethylene-aware | Chilling injury prevention
- **Zone C – Vegetable Freshness**
  - 1–7 °C | High humidity | Anti-wilting control

## 🤖 Key Features
- Real-time temperature & humidity simulation
